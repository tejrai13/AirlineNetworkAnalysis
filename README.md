# AirlineNetworkAnalysis

This repository contains a comprehensive Social Network Analysis (SNA) of the global airline route network. Using real-world data from the Open Flights dataset, the project explores key metrics such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality to identify the most critical airports and routes in the network. The analysis includes both static and dynamic visualizations, highlighting the geographical and structural connectivity of the airline industry.

Key features of this project include:

- Network Construction: Creation of a global airline route network using NetworkX and Plotly.
- Centrality Analysis: Identification of top airports based on centrality measures, highlighting their roles in global connectivity.
- Visualizations: Interactive 2D and 3D globe-based visualizations to analyze network structure and geographical spread.
- Recommendations: Insights and suggestions for improving operational efficiency, resilience, and connectivity in the airline industry.


This project serves as a powerful tool for understanding the complexities of airline operations and provides actionable insights for industry stakeholders.

The report contains the analysis of the results and recommendations. The code for the project is contained in Jupyter Notebook file.
